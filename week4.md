Week 4 Ship - USMC/18F Cloud PA - Jun 14, 2019
==============================================

Hello good people of the Marine Corps Cloud Corps (and friends):

Thanks to all who participated in our Sprint Review today. Â We've had a productive week with a half-dozen participant interviews plus the AWS summit. We're sifting and digesting what we've learned. See some additional details below.

We look forward to meeting more of you in person at our Mid-Project Review, June 21, at the Pentagon, when we'll present our preliminary finding for review and feedback.

Update on calendar invitations:

Our attempts to schedule recurring meetings with USMC folks using the GSA GSuite calendar have been frustrated by our inability to send updates without getting DMARC errors. So, to fix this:

-   Please delete any GSA-origin invites for Sprint Review, MidProject Review or other recurring meetings (any from 11 June or before)

-   Please accept as authoritative invites and updates from Major Jeremy F Thomas

This week we:

-   Finalized our interview questions

-   Conducted interviews according to our checklist of procedures

-   Provided Jeremy with the data that we have collected & scrubbed so far

-   Initiated building access process

-   Planned travel for onsite Mid-project Review

-   Collected additional documentation for desk research

-   Explored the possibility of using GitHub and Trello tools to share project artifacts and tasks with USMC

-   Met with many USMC cloud adopters at AWS public sector summit

Next week we will:

-   Conduct additional round of interviews

-   Distill interview findings into common themes and key points

-   Supplement interviews with desk research

-   Prepare materials for on-site Mid-Project Review

-   Hold on-site review
