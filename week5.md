Week 5 Ship - USMC/18F Cloud PA - Jun 21, 2019
==============================================

Week 5 Ship: June 21, 2019
Hi everyone,
This week marks the end to our initial round of research as well as the mid-point of this project. The project was originally scheduled for 8 weeks and will actually be spread across 10 calendar weeks given OOO. Today, we presented a subset of our findings so far. Next week, we’ll be sharing an expanded set for your feedback. We’ll also be charting out a course for the remainder of this project given what we learned in today’s Mid-project Review as well as discussion with C4 leadership. Read on for more details...

What we’re reading:

"Are there members of a community who, against all odds, have figured out a way to solve a problem, with no additional resources, much better than their peers?" The Positive Deviance Approach, explained by Dr. Arvind Singhal here.

This week we:
* Conducted more interviews as part of our research plan
* Generated initial findings based on our interview and desk research conducted so far
* Prepared for Mid-project Review at HQMC and traveled to HQMC
* Conducted Mid-project Review
* Met with General Mahlock, Deputy Director Ken Bible, and Colonel Lemott to discuss USMC Cloud vision and strategy and ensure those align with this project’s problem statement and outcomes
* Began reaching out to other 18F Department of Defense partners where there may be mutual benefit with USMC in swapping lessons learned and advice about cloud adoption 
* Scheduled Final Presentation for July 23, 2019

Next week we will:
* Create a BLUF project brief for decision-makers
* Conduct any remaining interviews
* Finalize desk research
* Begin conducting synthesis of all data collected
* Begin drafting recommendations and action items

What we’re thinking about:

| Week 1-2 | Weeks 3-4 | Weeks 5-6 | Weeks 7-8 |
|-----|-----|----|----|
| Kickoff Planning Research | Research Initial findings Mid-project check-in | Research **WE ARE HERE** Finalize findings Feedback Recommendations | Feedback Final presentation | 


The numbers:

Last week we billed $20,306 on this engagement which leaves $112,012.08 remaining. This puts us on track for a 7/26 end date, which is 2 weeks longer than originally planned. 


Thanks, 
Peter, Mark, and Eleni
