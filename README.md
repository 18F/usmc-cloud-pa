## U.S. Marine Corps Cloud - 18F Path Analysis

18F is partnered with the U.S. Marine Corps' (USMC) Command, Control, Communications, and Computers (C4) Department in an 8 week path analysis (PA) focused on understanding the USMC's current cloud governance posture, including learning about its cloud migration needs. This repo stores all project artifacts related to this PA. 

Initially, we're focusing on learning what USMC Functional Area Managers (FAMs) need to create transition plans to migrate USMC apps to Cloud. 

By the end of this project, we aim to:

1. Identify core considerations for migrating USMC systems to the Cloud
2. Develop a roadmap of opportunities for the USMC to pursue and strategy for prioritizing how/when to take action

We'll know we're successful if these outcomes:

1. Provide C4 with action items that are replicable across the enterprise
2. Identify existing resources within USMC, people and tools, that enable impacted stakeholders (FAMs, leadership, etc) to know what resources are available and how to take immediate action
